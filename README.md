# UI-Tailwind-Boilerplate

This repository has been set-up with support for Tailwind CSS. Please follow the setup instructions below to use the boilerplate correctly:

## Quick Start

<br>

1. Upon cloning the repository, go into the project directory and Install the required dev-dependencies by running

   ```bash
       npm install
   ```

<br>

2.  To start using the project, run the watch command. This would compile your `input.css` file to `output.css` in the `dist` folder.

    ```bash
        npm run watch
    ```

    This starts the Tailwind CLI build process<br>
    **Note: You still need to use the live-server (Go Live) extension to preview your HTML. To stop the watch-mode simply press `ctrl + c`**

<br>

### Instructions

- Using Tailwind, build the design or UI component provided on Figma.
